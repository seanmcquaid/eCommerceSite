// This the RootReducer!!!
// To make a RootReducer:
// 1. Get combineReducers method from redux
import {combineReducers} from "redux";
// 2. Call combineReducers method an pass it an object
import authReducer from "./authReducer";
// 3. Each key/property of the object, will be a single 
// function that returns a piece of application/redux state
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
    auth : authReducer
})
// 4. Each value will be a single reducer (imported)

export default rootReducer;
